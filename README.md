# Overview 

MasterTip is a fast and easy to use web application used to calculate tips. 
The application offers an option to split the tip among table members, which is a critical feature especially for cases involving big tips. 
For example, if a final bill presented to the customer is $200, and the customer wants to tip 20%, the tip would amount to $40 which, combined with the bill, would be a big financial strain to the customer. Mastertip's option to split enables people on the table to share that burden which, eventually, becomes manageable. 

Going back to the $40 tip, if, for example, there were 3 people on the table, everyone would contribute $13.33 - a reasonable amount compared to paying the whole tip alone.
